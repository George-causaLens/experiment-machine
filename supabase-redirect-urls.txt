# Supabase Redirect URLs to Add
# Go to your Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Redirect URLs
# Add these URLs:

https://experiment-machine.vercel.app
https://experiment-machine.vercel.app/
https://experiment-machine.vercel.app/password-reset
https://experiment-machine.vercel.app/auth/callback

# Site URL should be:

# IMPORTANT: Remove any localhost URLs from the redirect list
# This will prevent the security vulnerability where users are redirected to localhost
